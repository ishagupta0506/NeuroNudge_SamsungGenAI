## Description

Individuals with ADHD face unique productivity challenges such as **task activation difficulty**, **time blindness**, and **emotional regulation struggles**.  
NeuroNudge transforms these challenges into manageable steps through:

- **AI Task Decomposition**: Breaks down large tasks into small, digestible components.  
- **Mood-Adaptive Support**: Provides encouragement tailored to emotional state.  
- **Neuro-Friendly Timer**: Calming sounds and visual cues instead of jarring alerts.  
- **Pressure-Free Visuals**: Progress tracking without creating undue stress.  

Our aim is to provide a compassionate, adaptive focus companion that empowers users with sustainable productivity and self-compassion.
